# DATA-CEE-Method
Supplemenary Table
Supplementary Table 9 Adsorption characteristics of hyperaccumulator plants and their costs for remediation of soil heavy metal pollution
DATA is for calculating fallow implementation cost in China.

## Fallow implementation cost
The total cost associated with fallow implementation included mainly four parts: the amount of crop production capacity lost (P_i), financial subsidies to farmers (S_i), fallow matching funds (F_i), and management costs on cultivated land (M_i), which refers to the soil treatment fee during the period of fallow cultivated land, such as soil pollution remediation or ecological restoration of groundwater exploitation. 

## Function of Supplementary Table 9
Specifically, for soil pollution remediation, we collected common hyperaccumulator plantsâ€™ costs for remediation of soil heavy metals pollution in China, which included the detailed labor cost and expenses on production materials such as compound fertilizer, urea, and pesticide use. More details please see Supplementary Table 9.
